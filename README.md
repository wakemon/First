# First
First github repository; hopefully, ok doesn't say 'Hello World'. I wrote that program in 'C' a long time ago.
Not much to say really. I am a technology consultant. Mostly, I figure stuff out and explain it to others. I probably won't be making a lot of code. However, I am trying to expand my skills to learn more code and how the community operates.
